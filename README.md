1. **Locate the Configuration File**:
   The configuration file is located in the `nginx.conf` within the repository.

2. **Edit the Configuration**:
   Modify the `nginx.conf` file to adjust settings such as stream key, output resolution, and more.

3. **Restart the Server**:
   After making changes, restart the Docker container for the changes to take effect.

## Streaming to OBS Studio

To stream your DJI drone feed to OBS Studio, follow these steps:

1. **Open OBS Studio**.
2. **Add a New Source**:
   - Click on the "+" button in the Sources panel.
   - Select "Media Source".
   - Name it and click "OK".

3. **Configure the Media Source**:
   - Uncheck "Local File".
